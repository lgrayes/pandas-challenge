Data dive using Python Pandas

I’m so glad I was exposed to pandas as I am starting to see real world application beyond excel pivot tables. This gives a bigger picture of ‘big’ data. While excel may be able to do the job, pandas is definitely more efficient. With how much my boss requests to have reports RIGHT NOW, pandas will let me do that.

I need to learn it more. I struggled a lot on the 2nd part where I had to group by school criteria, so I wasn’t able to finish. But I do see how important it is to have your names of dataframes handy so you can easily refer to it. May be another habit to start creating.
